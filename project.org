* Notes for 6502 Assembly Programming
- print 1_234_567_890
- 499602d2
- 01001001 10010110 00000010 11010010

So, to convert hex number to decimal characters...
divide by 10 over and over again, and you get digits as remainder
Then convert digit to proper character code
-> 499602d2 / 10 -> r 0
-> divide and r 9
-> ..
-> left with 1
-> then get remainder 0

So store dividend,
set divisor to $0a (10)
set counter to 0 and increment in a loop
- Loop:
 + divide dividend by 10
+ push remainder on stack
+ check if dividend is 0, exit loop if done
+ increment counter, move quotient to dividend
