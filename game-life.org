* Notes

- How does CGAL work?
 + each cell lives or dies based on neighbors
   - live cell stays alive if =2 or =3 neighbors
   - live cell dies if <2 or >3 neighbors
   - dead cell comes to life if =3 neighbors
 + screen memory $0400
 + working area $2000
 + 

- code
  + clear the screen
  + start some cells
    - randomly turn alive X cells
  + take a turn
    - clear the working area
    - check each cell
      + if dead, skip, otherwise increment value of neighbors in working area
    - copy working area to screen memory
      + check working cell and screen cell
	- if working = 3, alive
	- if working =2 && screen = alive, alive
	- otherwise dead
    - pause
